# MatrixToolkit
##### by: Martin Je≈æko

This is a project I'm working on while studying CS, so I can improve my understanding C language, and implementing mathematical operations in it. I try to experiment and learn all the stuff by doing this.
By the time I will try to add more and more functions so It will actually be helpful.

## User Guide
### Using application
- In your terminal locate to the folder and launch by tiping  `./matrixtk`
- Select an option by typing a number:
- `1) Solve matrix` to find solution to a single matrix / system of equations:
	- `1) Find determinant` to find a determinant of a matrix ( | A | ).
	- `2) Solve {x, y, z}` to solve  a system of equations.
- `2) Operations with 2 matrixes` to sum | substract | multiply 2 different matrixes:
	- `1) A + B` to sum 2 matrixes (make sure they have the same dimensions).
	- `2) A - B` to substract second matrix from the first (need to have same dimensions as well).
	- `3) A * B` to multiply 2 matrixes with eachother (make sure the width of the first matrix is the same as height of the second matrix).
- Or type `0` to leave the program.

### Compiling
Feel free to edit the code in any way you like. If you want to compile the edited code you can do so by writing `make` in your terminal, in the folder the file "Makefile" is located.
If you want to edit the compile config then edit the "Makefile" file.
