# MatrixToolkit
##### by: Martin Je≈æko

This is a project I'm working on while studying CS, so I can improve
my understanding C language, and implementing mathematical operations
in it. I try to experiment and learn all the stuff by doing this.

By the time I will try to add more and more functions so It will actually be helpful.
